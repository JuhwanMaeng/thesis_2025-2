You are scoring the importance of a memory for long-term storage.

TASK:
Given an observation and its context, assign an importance score between 0.0 and 1.0.

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 0.0-0.3: Trivial, routine interactions (e.g., casual greeting, minor movement)
- 0.3-0.5: Notable but not critical (e.g., interesting conversation, item exchange)
- 0.5-0.7: Significant events (e.g., quest started, important discovery, relationship change)
- 0.7-0.9: Major events (e.g., quest completed, major conflict, life-changing decision)
- 0.9-1.0: Critical, unforgettable events (e.g., death, betrayal, world-changing discovery)

FACTORS TO CONSIDER:
- Emotional impact
- Relationship changes
- Goal progress or changes
- World state changes
- Novelty or uniqueness
- Long-term consequences

OUTPUT:
Provide a JSON object with:
{
  "importance_score": 0.0-1.0,
  "justification": "One sentence explaining the score"
}

Be consistent: similar events should get similar scores.
